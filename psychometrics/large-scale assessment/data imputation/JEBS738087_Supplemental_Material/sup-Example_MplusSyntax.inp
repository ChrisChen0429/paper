TITLE:
Empirical example using data from PISA 2012;
DATA:
FILE = ..._list.dat;   ! replace "..." with prefix for imputation method
TYPE = IMPUTATION;     ! (e.g., "jm_list.dat")

VARIABLE:
NAMES = SCHOOLID GENDER ESCS CLSMAN STUDREL PVMATH NSTU NCMP;
USEVARIABLES = SCHOOLID GENDER ESCS CLSMAN STUDREL PVMATH NSTU NCMP SCHESCS;
BETWEEN = NSTU NCMP SCHESCS;
WITHIN = GENDER ESCS;
CLUSTER = SCHOOLID;

DEFINE:
SCHESCS = CLUSTER_MEAN (ESCS);   ! manifest cluster means for ESCS
CENTER ESCS (GROUPMEAN);         ! cluster mean centering for ESCS
CENTER SCHESCS (GRANDMEAN);      ! grand mean centering for SCHESCH

ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL;

MODEL:
%within%
PVMATH on GENDER ESCS CLSMAN STUDREL;
%between%
PVMATH on NSTU NCMP SCHESCS CLSMAN STUDREL;
